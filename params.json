{"name":"Test","tagline":"Random C++ concept test files","body":"This repository is a test repository as the name implies.  I only put small source files in this repository which serve to help me figure out simple concepts and rules of C++ which I did not feel like looking up.\r\n\r\nThe files included are:\r\nhello.cpp\r\npointers.cpp\r\nreplicator.cpp\r\nstring.cpp\r\n\r\nThe hello.cpp file was an inevitable addition.\r\n\r\nThe pointers.cpp file plays around with a single int pointer and a function pointer.\r\n\r\nThe replicator.cpp file came from a challenge my friend saw in a C++ book.  I do not know if I played by the rules but the end product is a program which outputs it's source code to the screen.\r\n\r\nThe string.cpp file reminds me how substr() works and also what 1 gets interpreted as as a bool.\r\n\r\nFeel free to download and change them, I don't really care.  If you want to submit pull requests, and I don't know why you would, I may get around to them.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
