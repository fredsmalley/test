        <p>This repository is a test repository as the name implies.  I only put small source files in this repository which serve to help me figure out simple concepts and rules of C++ which I did not feel like looking up.</p>

<p>The files included are:
hello.cpp
pointers.cpp
replicator.cpp
string.cpp</p>

<p>The hello.cpp file was an inevitable addition.</p>

<p>The pointers.cpp file plays around with a single int pointer and a function pointer.</p>

<p>The replicator.cpp file came from a challenge my friend saw in a C++ book.  I do not know if I played by the rules but the end product is a program which outputs it's source code to the screen.</p>

<p>The string.cpp file reminds me how substr() works and also what 1 gets interpreted as as a bool.</p>

<p>Feel free to download and change them, I don't really care.  If you want to submit pull requests, and I don't know why you would, I may get around to them.</p>
